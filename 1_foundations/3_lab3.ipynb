I'm an entrepreneur, software engineer and data scientist. I'm originally from London, England, but I moved to NYC in 2000.\\nI love all foods, particularly French food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.\\n\\n## LinkedIn Profile:\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\nContact\\ned.donner@gmail.com\\nwww.linkedin.com/in/eddonner\\n(LinkedIn)\\nedwarddonner.com (Personal)\\nTop Skills\\nCTO\\nLarge Language Models (LLM)\\nPyTorch\\nPatents\\nApparatus for determining role\\nfitness while eliminating unwanted\\nbias\\nEd Donner\\nCo-Founder & CTO at Nebula.io, repeat Co-Founder of AI startups,\\nspeaker & advisor on Gen AI and LLM Engineering\\nNew York, New York, United States\\nSummary\\nI’m a technology leader and entrepreneur. I'm applying AI to a field\\nwhere it can make a massive impact: helping people discover their\\npotential and pursue their reason for being. But at my core, I’m a\\nsoftware engineer and a scientist. I learned how to code aged 8 and\\nstill spend weekends experimenting with Large Language Models\\nand writing code (rather badly). If you’d like to join us to show me\\nhow it’s done.. message me!\\nAs a work-hobby, I absolutely love giving talks about Gen AI and\\nLLMs. I'm the author of a best-selling, top-rated Udemy course\\non LLM Engineering, and I speak at O'Reilly Live Events and\\nODSC workshops. It brings me great joy to help others unlock the\\nastonishing power of LLMs.\\nI spent most of my career at JPMorgan building software for financial\\nmarkets. I worked in London, Tokyo and New York. I became an MD\\nrunning a global organization of 300. Then I left to start my own AI\\nbusiness, untapt, to solve the problem that had plagued me at JPM -\\nwhy is so hard to hire engineers?\\nAt untapt we worked with GQR, one of the world's fastest growing\\nrecruitment firms. We collaborated on a patented invention in AI\\nand talent. Our skills were perfectly complementary - AI leaders vs\\nrecruitment leaders - so much so, that we decided to join forces. In\\n2020, untapt was acquired by GQR’s parent company and Nebula\\nwas born.\\nI’m now Co-Founder and CTO for Nebula, responsible for software\\nengineering and data science.  Our stack is Python/Flask, React,\\nMongo, ElasticSearch, with Kubernetes on GCP. Our 'secret sauce'\\nis our use of Gen AI and proprietary LLMs. If any of this sounds\\ninteresting - we should talk!\\n\\xa0 Page 1 of 5\\xa0 \\xa0\\nExperience\\nNebula.io\\nCo-Founder & CTO\\nJune 2021\\xa0-\\xa0Present\\xa0(3 years 10 months)\\nNew York, New York, United States\\nI’m the co-founder and CTO of Nebula.io. We help recruiters source,\\nunderstand, engage and manage talent, using Generative AI / proprietary\\nLLMs. Our patented model matches people with roles with greater accuracy\\nand speed than previously imaginable — no keywords required.\\nOur long term goal is to help people discover their potential and pursue their\\nreason for being, motivated by a concept called Ikigai. We help people find\\nroles where they will be most fulfilled and successful; as a result, we will raise\\nthe level of human prosperity. It sounds grandiose, but since 77% of people\\ndon’t consider themselves inspired or engaged at work, it’s completely within\\nour reach.\\nSimplified.Travel\\nAI Advisor\\nFebruary 2025\\xa0-\\xa0Present\\xa0(2 months)\\nSimplified Travel is empowering destinations to deliver unforgettable, data-\\ndriven journeys at scale.\\nI'm giving AI advice to enable highly personalized itinerary solutions for DMOs,\\nhotels and tourism organizations, enhancing traveler experiences.\\nGQR Global Markets\\nChief Technology Officer\\nJanuary 2020\\xa0-\\xa0Present\\xa0(5 years 3 months)\\nNew York, New York, United States\\nAs CTO of parent company Wynden Stark, I'm also responsible for innovation\\ninitiatives at GQR.\\nWynden Stark\\nChief Technology Officer\\nJanuary 2020\\xa0-\\xa0Present\\xa0(5 years 3 months)\\nNew York, New York, United States\\nWith the acquisition of untapt, I transitioned to Chief Technology Officer for the\\nWynden Stark Group, responsible for Data Science and Engineering.\\n\\xa0 Page 2 of 5\\xa0 \\xa0\\nuntapt\\n6 years 4 months\\nFounder, CTO\\nMay 2019\\xa0-\\xa0January 2020\\xa0(9 months)\\nGreater New York City Area\\nI founded untapt in October 2013; emerged from stealth in 2014 and went\\ninto production with first product in 2015.
